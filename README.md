learning how to create a new repository

Hi! sll1026 here.

I'm doing my thesis on using ANNs to predict electrochemical properties, and it's been a few years since I took my introduction to python course. I'm currently learning octave for my quantum chemistry course too. I'm dog-crazed over MDZS, specifically LWJ.
